Standardizes the Elementor buttons with global classes that can be managed in a single place with custom css.


== Description ==

Tired of having to update every single button style in your [Elementor](https://elementor.com/) website when the client asks for a change? Not too happy with Elementor's default button Styles or Sizes? Do you wish you were able to modify, add or remove them? Then this plugin is just what you need!

**Global Elementor Buttons** standardizes Elementor Buttons with global classes that can be managed in a single place with custom css (and it works with both Elementor and Elementor Pro!).


### Details ###

This plugin creates a new Elementor Widget, called **Global Button** that contains a simplified UI, just with the necessary controls to keep all of your buttons global and flexible. However, in the need of a special button, you can still add specific ids or classes to them!

Includes a handful of useful hooks for full flexibility:
1. Set your own custom Style and Size classes (for example, btn-**primary**).
2. Add / remove existent Style and Size classes.
3. Change or remove the Style and Size prefix (for example, **btn-**primary).
4. Edit the default Style and Size class.

For demonstration purposes, this plugin adds a minified version of the [Bootstrap Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/) stylesheet. Global Elementor Buttons allows you to remove this stylesheet, for performance and complexity reasons.
